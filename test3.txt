Hi im trying my own to push a file from my pc to the git hub
and i named that file as test3.txt


Im checking that is that any change happen in the website github when im add some changes in the file from vs code 
after pushing the file into github ...Lemme check

Ohh shit it doesnt work...now i realised that every time when you change some thing in the file you need to add and push the file again 
into github......youy should add the commit message also

wait ill check again

\\\
yessss it worked now....
Finally im bit learning how can i work with git....not so much but i learned something new...and its exciting to meee

///
Now i gonna try something new ...im trying to delete a file and gonna find how to delete and make the chsnges in the github
Now im trying and find the way and i give an update here 
/////////
Yes...i found the keyword to delete a file ...and the KEYWORD IS "RM {FILE NAME }".....then commit the hanges and add the 
commit message ...then push to the main branch as usuall when you pusb after making a change


////
ANOTHER TASK
pulling the chsanges from the github..after i cerated a file inside the prepo on the github....now we want to get the changes to 
Vs code which was made oin the gihub....and the keyword for that is 
"PULL"
NOW IM GOINNA TRY AND GIVE THE UPDATE here
/////

i faced a problem when i tried to pull the changes but i asked chatgpt how to resolve this issue ...but i dont know what isssue was that
but chatgpt said to type :wq   i dont know why..but i will found that later

////
but i maked the changes here what i made there on github


/////
Ohhhh we can make the changes here also right>>>
i just tried that...here means ..in the github and pull  from  there to vs code 
'

when every modificaiton need the step that
[ MODIFY >> ADDD >> COMMMIT >> PUSH]

THIS WAS I LEARNED THROUGH THE LAST SOME TASKS

\//// NOW I GOT A NEW TASK THAT I WANTED TO CREATE A NEW FOLDER INSIDE THE VS CODE AND  NEED TO UPDATE ON THE GIT hub
now im gonna try this and update the result below atfter the try :)

///Heyyy i faced a lot ;(

When im tried to create the folder i created the folder very easily then after that i faced a lotif problems when
i tried to post on that on my github...its been a bit challengin to me....

/// but finally im learned that how can i do it....

LETS GOOOO//
1.First create he folder on the PC User files or In the vs code...create how ever you WANTED
    >>>create a file inside that..


    [WHEN YOU WANT TO EXIT FROM THE LAST PATH YOU CURRENTLY IN...JUST TYPE{cd ..}]...IT WILL GET YOU OUT FROM there
   [[]] AGAIN TO REACH ANOTHER FOLDER SIMPLY  TYPE {cd {The folder name}}]]






2. then you should createa new reposotory on the github
3.After that you should copy the repository address and and add inside the vs code...oi willl say how to do it
        1.type git remote add origin [ the address{ignore the brackets just add the address here}]
        2.then you can add the changes ..commit the changes ..when  i tried  to push to the github thats a problem i faced
           the origin name was changed then after i checked the new branch name using [git branch]...then\
           i pushed the file as usual

///Now creating a new branch   thats the task now 

when you working on a folder or file...if you want to check curently which branch you are working on..
you have to use this keyword on the terminal of vs code 
   KEY WORD IS    --->>    git branch -a after you enter this key word it will you list all the branches you have and
   it will hilight the current branch you are working on

   Now if you want to create a new branch you need to go to the github and  create a branch in the branch tag on the github

   after that you nee tu pull the changes to vs code by using git pull

   ///
   If you wantto change the branch you currently working on you need to use te keyword i write below
   KEYWORD IS -->>>   git checkout [banch name]   (iginore the brackets here tooo)

   now you can push the file using the new branch name bcz you know the new branch right...


   //// Yes i found out that for what we are creating new branches..

For example think 5 members working on a git file..main branh included corrected fils and important files..
when everyone working they can work on a file inside their own branch and then after they can push the file to the main branch

/// so you can wokr on your own branch and after finalize   you can push inside the main branch... thats the use of creating]
new  branches

POINT:::::
when you checkout the main branch you cant see the sub branch files if you didnt merge the files yet
so you want to merge the sub branch with the main branch to show the sub branch files inside the main branch

///// SO THE NEXT TASK IS MERGEEEE\\

So this is how i megred my sub branch with the main branch
so i checkout the main branch first..
\
Now im inside the mainn branch..now i can merge the sub branch with the main branch using the keyword below
THE KEYWORD IS   (git merge [new branch name])   (ignore the brackets here too)
///

Now after that i went to the guthub to check does the sub branch files are visibile inside the main branch\
owww..i cant ...i forget to push in the vs code

afte that i pushed the chanegs...
git push origin main

now its visible.....////

/// If you  want to create a new branch inside the Vs code manually you need to use this keywords
git branch (new branch name)    [ignore the brackets]

So  New branch
When yout try to merge a sub branch with the main branch you need to ask for the  pull request in the github
the main branch owner compare and see the changes and then he will merge the subbranch with the main branch 

So the  moral is when you dont have the accsess to merge the sub branch with the main branch youned to send the 
pull request

/////
When you are trying to create a new branch inside the visual studio code and then you can use the line(mentioned above also)
git branch (new name)

just add the changes then commit messages and just push with the new branch created then you can see the newly created branch
in the github website .... until you push ..you cannot see the new created branch ///
so the manually created branch was pushed succcessfully inside the github/

////PULL request
