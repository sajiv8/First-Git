Hi im trying my own to push a file from my pc to the git hub
and i named that file as test3.txt


Im checking that is that any change happen in the website github when im add some changes in the file from vs code 
after pushing the file into github ...Lemme check

Ohh shit it doesnt work...now i realised that every time when you change some thing in the file you need to add and push the file again 
into github......youy should add the commit message also

wait ill check again
