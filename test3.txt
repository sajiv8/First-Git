Hi im trying my own to push a file from my pc to the git hub
and i named that file as test3.txt


Im checking that is that any change happen in the website github when im add some changes in the file from vs code 
after pushing the file into github ...Lemme check

Ohh shit it doesnt work...now i realised that every time when you change some thing in the file you need to add and push the file again 
into github......youy should add the commit message also

wait ill check again

\\\
yessss it worked now....
Finally im bit learning how can i work with git....not so much but i learned something new...and its exciting to meee

///
Now i gonna try something new ...im trying to delete a file and gonna find how to delete and make the chsnges in the github
Now im trying and find the way and i give an update here 
/////////
Yes...i found the keyword to delete a file ...and the KEYWORD IS "RM {FILE NAME }".....then commit the hanges and add the 
commit message ...then push to the main branch as usuall when you pusb after making a change


////
ANOTHER TASK
pulling the chsanges from the github..after i cerated a file inside the prepo on the github....now we want to get the changes to 
Vs code which was made oin the gihub....and the keyword for that is 
"PULL"
NOW IM GOINNA TRY AND GIVE THE UPDATE here
/////

i faced a problem when i tried to pull the changes but i asked chatgpt how to resolve this issue ...but i dont know what isssue was that
but chatgpt said to type :wq   i dont know why..but i will found that later

////
but i maked the changes here what i made there on github


/////
Ohhhh we can make the changes here also right>>>
i just tried that...here means ..in the github and pull  from  there to vs code 
'

when every modificaiton need the step that
[ MODIFY >> ADDD >> COMMMIT >> PUSH]

THIS WAS I LEARNED THROUGH THE LAST SOME TASKS

\//// NOW I GOT A NEW TASK THAT I WANTED TO CREATE A NEW FOLDER INSIDE THE VS CODE AND  NEED TO UPDATE ON THE GIT hub
now im gonna try this and update the result below atfter the try :)

///Heyyy i faced a lot ;(

When im tried to create the folder i created the folder very easily then after that i faced a lotif problems when
i tried to post on that on my github...its been a bit challengin to me....

/// but finally im learned that how can i do it....

LETS GOOOO//
1.First create he folder on the PC User files or In the vs code...create how ever you WANTED
    >>>create a file inside that..


    [WHEN YOU WANT TO EXIT FROM THE LAST PATH YOU CURRENTLY IN...JUST TYPE{cd ..}]...IT WILL GET YOU OUT FROM there
   [[]] AGAIN TO REACH ANOTHER FOLDER SIMPLY  TYPE {cd {The folder name}}]]






2. then you should createa new reposotory on the github
3.After that you should copy the repository address and and add inside the vs code...oi willl say how to do it
        1.type git remote add origin [ the address{ignore the brackets just add the address here}]
        2.then you can add the changes ..commit the changes ..when  i tried  to push to the github thats a problem i faced
           the origin name was changed then after i checked the new branch name using [git branch]...then\
           i pushed the file as usual
