Hi im trying my own to push a file from my pc to the git hub
and i named that file as test3.txt


Im checking that is that any change happen in the website github when im add some changes in the file from vs code 
after pushing the file into github ...Lemme check

Ohh shit it doesnt work...now i realised that every time when you change some thing in the file you need to add and push the file again 
into github......youy should add the commit message also

wait ill check again

\\\
yessss it worked now....
Finally im bit learning how can i work with git....not so much but i learned something new...and its exciting to meee

///
Now i gonna try something new ...im trying to delete a file and gonna find how to delete and make the chsnges in the github
Now im trying and find the way and i give an update here 
/////////
Yes...i found the keyword to delete a file ...and the KEYWORD IS "RM {FILE NAME }".....then commit the hanges and add the 
commit message ...then push to the main branch as usuall when you pusb after making a change


////
ANOTHER TASK
pulling the chsanges from the github..after i cerated a file inside the prepo on the github....now we want to get the changes to 
Vs code which was made oin the gihub....and the keyword for that is 
"PULL"
NOW IM GOINNA TRY AND GIVE THE UPDATE here
/////

i faced a problem when i tried to pull the changes but i asked chatgpt how to resolve this issue ...but i dont know what isssue was that
but chatgpt said to type :wq   i dont know why..but i will found that later

////
